              2016: During recess, a big group of us fifth graders were chasing down one more player during a game of Team Tag. It was the fall, so school had just begun. The air was crisp and the leaves were alluring. We ran without a care in the world, forming new friendships, bursting with laughs, creating new experiences that become thousands of memories ingrained into our essence...

                The Bronx is a place full of rich memories. The most significant treasure from my home has to be my elementary/middle school, PS/MS 194. It built me into the person I am today.
                194 was unique compared to my high school in its diversity. It was a crucible of all children from different backgrounds. Asian, Hispanic, and African American students all under one roof. Every year, 194 held “Culture Day,” in which you brought in national dishes and wore ethnic clothing to represent and celebrate your race. Children circled the desks in their cerulean Saris, vermilion Kimonos, golden Huipils, mesmerized by the appetizing courses laid out in front of them. We rushed to be first in line, quickly filling our plates with peppery curry chicken, piquant dumplings, and savory mofongo. Everyone grouped together and sat down in their cultural attire and dishes, chattering about their home lives. It was captivating listening to how our lifestyles differed from one another, yet there we were, united in the same building, learning and respecting each other's customs. Sharing laughs and tender moments, we bonded through our culture. Entering 194’s doors, these students couldn’t have been more different. Upon leaving, we all discovered something indistinguishable: the keen love and appreciation for the insight gained from being together. Instead of making it a barrier towards socializing, we all admired each other’s backgrounds. As a person of color growing up in a multicultural school, I was exposed to more diversity and varieties of people than I was in my high school. I’m forever grateful for the cultural acceptance and awareness I acquired during my development stages at 194.

              Learning about the varying cultures didn’t only expose me to more diversity. It helped me gain perception about my family's financial status. Understanding how poverty impacted the lives of my classmates made me value everything I had. Though I hadn’t felt it before, I was considered rich. While I had Nike sneakers, they had shoes from Payless. While I had clear invisalign aligners, they couldn’t even afford braces. I had taken these privileges for granted. Here my friends were, enthralled by the luxurious items I wore to school, items I had resented for not being the Abercrombie & Fitch sweater I wanted. These compliments from my peers gave me consciousness. I started to be more appreciative of how hard my parents worked to give me an established life. I’ve cherished every blessing I’ve received since then.

              As I graduated PS MS/ 194 in 2019, I felt as if a part of me left. My elementary and middle school years were over, marking the official end to my childhood. The overall experience felt short-lived, but it helped prepare me for the future and finishing eighth grade was its way of saying “goodbye.” It encapsulated growing up in New York City. Life is pretty fast here. If you don’t stop and admire its features, it’s easy to miss. 194 would be proud of the person I’ve become today. I absorbed every insight and ingrained them into my soul. Upon entering high school, PS MS 194 taught me one of the most important lessons I’ve learned throughout my entire life: it is only until life carries on that we realize how certain experiences helped to shape us into the people we are today. And isn’t that what growing up is all about?
